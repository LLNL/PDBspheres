PDBspheres is a structure-based method for finding and evaluating structural similarities in protein regions relevant to 
ligand binding. PDBspheres comprises an exhaustive library of protein structure regions (“spheres”) adjacent to complexed 
ligands derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), along with methods to find and evaluate structural matches between a protein 
of interest and spheres in the library. PDBspheres uses the LGA structure alignment algorithm as the main engine for detecting 
structure similarities between the protein of interest and template spheres from the library, which currently contains more 
than 2 million spheres. To assess confidence in structural matches an all-atom-based similarity metric takes sidechain placement 
into account.
